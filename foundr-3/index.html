				<p>In the 19th Century, Mount Everest was thought to be impossible to scale. It was too high, the weather was too unrelenting, and the terrain was too complicated.</p>
				<p>Everything changed on May 29, 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay did the impossible—they summited the mountain and reached the highest peak in the world.</p>

							<p>When you think about building a massive, engaged email list — a modern marketing necessity that nonetheless takes a lot of time and effort to achieve — you might feel a bit like you’re at the base of Everest, staring up at a distant peak. You might be thinking it's too hard, that you don't have enough resources, knowledge, or time to pull it off.</p>
							<p>But the great thing about this particular summit is that there are many others who have been there before.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<p>You don’t have to be the Edmund Hillary of email lists, and you have plenty of guides, digital sherpas, and tons of technological resources all within reach. </p>

			<div class="container">
				<p>The effort needs to come from you, but when it comes to finding the information you need—Foundr is here to be your personal guide to the most important marketing strategy your company can pursue. </p>
				<p>In this 8-chapter guide, you will learn everything there is to know about building your list, including:</p>
				<ul class="list stars">
					<li>Why building your email list matters</li>

					<h2>Who Is This Guide For?</h2>
					<p>The beauty of email marketing lies in the fact it's industry-agnostic. Anyone from any industry, business size, or home country can reap its benefits.</p>
					<p>This guide will be particularly useful for people who:</p>

					<ul class="list stars">
						<li>Want to start an email list to promote their business but don’t know where to start</li>
						<li>Have fewer than 1,000 subscribers and want to 2x, 10x, or 20x the number of subscribers</li>
						<li>Have a decent-sized list — somewhere between 1,000 to 10,000 subscribers — but want to learn how to automate the process and scale that number to 50,000 to 100,000 subscribers, quickly.</li>

				<p>As you decide how much you want to invest in this process, you may be asking yourself: Does building an email list really matter? Is this just another BS thing online marketing gurus are going on about so they can make more money off of me?</p>
				<p>Well, you can ask <a href="#">Pat Flynn</a>, who despite having no email list for the first two years of his business (yes, a huge mistake as you will see in later chapters), he still managed to <a href="#">accumulate 10,000 subscribers</a> in a little over a year, and double his revenue in the process.</p>

In a few short years, GrooveHQ was able to <a href="#">grow to 100,000 subscribers</a> and generate over $5 million in annual revenue.</p>

				<h3 class="title-h3">The Basics of Email List Building</h3>
				<p>Many new business owners believe email list building is a complementary task they need to do, like developing a Facebook page or designing a business card. But actually, building an email list is one of those tasks you should really start long before you think you have the spare time to do it.</p>
				<p>Developing an email list allows you to find a core audience that's interested in hearing from you—people who believe in your business. In marketing speak, the core goal of email list building is to "generate leads." But what is a lead? It's someone who's interested in your business.  </p>
				<p>Remember that, because when you think about building your email list, remember that you aren’t forcing anyone to be interested in your business. You are just making them aware of how your business can make their lives better. Your email will help you take them from point A (their problems) to point B (your solutions).</p>
				<p>While all this looks great, let’s take a deeper look at what taking your audience from Point A to Point B actually looks like.</p>
			</div>

			<img src="img/img-8.svg" alt="" class="img-8">
			<div class="container">
				<p>Email marketing plays an essential role in this process by helping you send targeted messages at the time your subscriber needs them most.</p>
				<p>For example, when you attract them to your list using a “lead offer” (something we’ll touch on in Chapter 2), you’re helping them learn something of value. Then, you continue to send them content updates, which should be related to the original problem.</p>
				<p>As the subscriber becomes more interested in your content and offers, you change the content from informational to commercial. While you will continue providing them with useful content, you will also send them special offers and discounts, new product announcements (which can be tied to a discount), and more.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="block-5">
				<div class="container">
					<div class="left-block">
						<p>It’s remarkably effective.</p>
						<p>In 2016, WBR Digital and emarsys carried out a survey of almost 300 retail professionals from US companies with $100 million+ in annual revenue, and found 81% consider email marketing as their best customer acquisition channel.</p>
						<p>At the end of the day, the power of email marketing is in the power of communication. While other tactics like Facebook Ads and Google Adwords rely on a more forceful approach to attract leads, email marketing helps you make a more natural and valuable connection with your potential customers.</p>

				<h3 class="title-h3">FAQs About List Building</h3>
				<p>If you’re still wondering if you’re ready to start a list-building campaign, or have lingering questions, here are the most important and commonly asked ones we get all the time. Get these concerns out the way, and then it’s time for action. Remember: <b>fortune favors the bold.</b></p>

				<div class="article">
					<h3 class="article__title">Should I start even if I have little or no traffic?</h3>
					<p>Waiting until you have enough traffic is a common excuse people use to put off starting their business. Why do we say that? Because if you wait until you have a large audience (an arbitrary metric), or a perfect design, or a product to sell, you will never start.</p>
					<p>It’s never too soon to invite people to sign up for your newsletter, and many founders will start with just a signup form to gauge interest, before they have anything even resembling a business. </p>
					<p>If you have little to no traffic, <b>start small</b>. Open an account with an email service provider (the next section shows a list of the best ones we recommend), create a simple opt-in box, and voilà! You are on the way to building your email list.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="article">
					<h3 class="article__title">My business has been around for years. Is it ever too late to start list building?</h3>
					<p>Not at all! On the contrary, now is the best time to get started. Sure, you may have grown much faster if you had started earlier, but that’s okay. Now that you know how important building a list is, start today.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="article">
					<h3 class="article__title">Can’t I just buy a list? </h3>
					<p>This is a highly common question, and at first glance, it makes sense. There are people who sell this information, so why don’t you just buy it? That’s a growth hack, isn’t it?</p>
					<p>Actually, it’s a <b>horrible idea</b>. You always want to own your list. No one likes to get unsolicited emails. Not only is it illegal in certain regions, it’s also unethical. Asking permission to message your subscribers will also make your email communications more effective and transparent.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="container">
				<h3 class="title-h3">What a List-Building Strategy Looks Like</h3>
				<p>If you are intimidated by the idea of a list-building strategy, then worry not, because it's simpler to understand than you think. It’s just a matter of knowing how to execute each element, and then working through them all.</p>
				<p>Below we will walk you through an overview of a typical list-building strategy. The rest of this guide will be dedicated to explaining these steps in more detail. </p>
				<p>Here’s a visual of what a list-building strategy looks like:</p>

				<div class="p-ico-wrap">
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--1">A list-building strategy starts with a <b>lead offer</b>. This is something you give away for free in exchange for your subscriber’s personal information, most importantly, their email address.</p>
					
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--2">While you can offer this gift throughout your site — in your homepage, in your articles, etc. — you need a place to offer it independently from the rest of your site so you can focus on your marketing and maximizing conversions. For this, you will use lead forms and a <b>landing page.</b></p>
					
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--3">Once you get the lead (i.e., the subscriber opted in for your lead offer), the job isn’t done. At this point, the lead is excited to learn more about your company, so optimizing your thank you page and your <b>confirmation email</b> is paramount to make the most out your list-building strategy.</p>
					
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--4">At this point, you will have the three main list-building elements in place. But how do you promote your lead offer? How do you actually attract people to your landing pages? Here’s where you will use a variety of <b>list-building tactics</b> to blow up your list size (and your profits). </p>
					
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--5">After you start growing your list, you will reach a point where you will want to take your list-building efforts even further. There are many <b>advanced tactics</b> and <b>tricks</b> you can use, including co-marketing, influencer marketing, and paid social media.</p>
					
					<p class="p-ico p-ico--6">As you grow your list, you will have to keep it in shape. While often overlooked, <b>keeping your list healthy</b> will help you save money and increase your email marketing effectiveness.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Not so complicated, right? We will go over all of these elements in this guide. When you finish, you’ll see it’s not only simple but also fun.</p>
			</div>

				<div class="container">
					<h3 class="title-h3">Best Email Marketing Tools</h3>

			<h2 class="chapter-title">Crafting Your Lead Offer</h2>
	
			<img class="img-12" src="img/img-12.png" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<h3 class="title-h3">What is a Lead Offer?</h3>
				<p>The first element you need to have in order to build your list is a lead offer.</p>
				<p>A lead offer is a free piece of content that’s gated, meaning you give it away in exchange for the subscriber’s personal information, which can technically be anything: phone number, address, website, social media profile, and most importantly, their email address.</p>
				<p>For the purpose of this guide, we’ll focus on getting emails, but just remember, you can ask for more information if you need it. (Usually, sales teams use the other pieces of personal information to “qualify” leads, so unless you are going to use your lead offer for sales, requesting an email address is more than enough.)</p>
				<p>The lead offer can come in many forms, including:</p>

				<ul class="list stars list-col-2">
					<li>Ebooks</li>
					<li>Worksheets</li>
					<li>Video training</li>
					<li>Email course</li>
					<li>Audio training or recordings</li>
					<li>White papers</li>
					<li>Templates</li>
					<li>Cheatsheets</li>
					<li>Case studies</li>
					<li>Product sheets</li>
					<li>Webinars</li>
				</ul>

				<p>At Foundr, we have used many such lead offers to <a href="#">grow our own email list</a>. One example is a <a href="#">masterclass</a> (i.e., a webinar/training) that we use to promote our Start & Scale course.</p>
			</div>
			<img class="img-13" src="img/img-13.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>We like webinars/videos because they are a great way to load up tons of value for your audience and overdeliver big time. But marketing-savvy companies use all types of lead offers.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Single Grain</a>, the marketing agency, uses a wide range, including courses, guides, and videos.</p>
			</div>

			<img src="img/img-14.jpg" alt="" class="img-14">
			<div class="container">
				<p>Even large corporations like IBM use lead offers.</p>
			</div>

			<img src="img/img-15.jpg" alt="" class="img-15">

			<div class="container">
				<p>The key to lead offers is to make the incentive clear, so your readers know they’re getting a large amount of value for free.</p>
			</div>


				<div class="container">
					<h3 class="title-h3">Other Ways to Build Your List</h3>
					<p>Lead offers represent a bridge in the <a href="#">marketing funnel</a>, as it takes people from the Awareness step, when people are beginning to learn about their problems, to the Consideration step, when they're starting to identify ways to solve them. </p>
					<p>Your lead offer is the beginning to that solution. Your final offer—the paid product or service—is the solution that solves their entire problem.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/img-8.svg" alt="" class="img-8">

				<div class="container">
					<p>While lead offers are highly effective, there are other ways to get people’s email addresses:</p>

					<ul class="list stars">
						<li><b>Transactional:</b> Get an email after/when someone buys from you. These people are primed for upselling, cross-selling, and loyalty programs.</li>
						<li><b>Updates:</b> When someone joins your list to get updates when you publish new content. These offers are usually not tied to an incentive, so these people are true fans of your brand. </li>
						<li><b>Waitlist:</b> If you are about to launch a new product, you can get people on a waitlist and notify them when it launches. These people are a mix of the previous two groups: they want to hear from you, but only related to the launch.</li>
						<li><b>Contest:</b> After someone signs up for a contest. As a rule of thumb, subscribers who sign up for contest aren't as engaged because they have subscribed to get their prize, not to hear from your company. Your challenge is to engage them.</li>
						<li><b>Discounts:</b> Although discounts are a great way to build a list, they place a cap on your average order value, since you are lowering your margins. If you can justify the increase in subscribers or customers for the long term, then this tactic will work. Discounts can also lower your brand perception because people focus more on your discounts than the value your products provide, potentially lowering chances of building loyalty and trust. All this can be solved just as in the point before, by giving as much value as possible to the segment associated with a discount campaign.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In every case on this list, you’ll have to segment them (more later) and adapt your emails accordingly.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Quality Trumps Quantity</h4>
					<p>Lead offers shouldn't be complicated. Focus on the quality of your lead offers, not the quantity of words, time, or money invested in it. </p>
					<p>It’s great you want to give amazing content to your subscribers, but don't overcomplicate it. Instead of creating a 75-page ebook, keep it at 20 pages and fill it with actionable information.</p>
					<p>The key is to make your prospect’s life easier. </p>
					<p>Scratch one itch, but scratch it well. </p>	

					<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">How to Come Up With a Great Lead Offer</h4>
					<p>The first thing you need to consider when looking for an idea is to keep it simple. You don’t have to have a unique, mind-blowing idea to attract leads; you only need to solve their problems.</p>
					<p>The question now becomes, how do you solve their problems? More importantly, what problems do they have?</p>
					<p>To answer the latter question, you need to find out what your customers want. For example, we know a segment of our audience is ecommerce store owners who want to grow their Instagram profiles so they can develop loyal audiences likely to convert into customers. Let’s break this down:</p>
					<div class="row how-come">
						

						<div class="col">
							<h5>Audience: </h5>
							<p>One-person ecommerce store owners</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col">
							<h5>Problems: </h5>
							<p>Limited time or money to grow Instagram audience</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col">
							<h5>Need:</h5>
							<p>Actionable advice on growing their Instagram audience</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col">
							<h5>Want:</h5>
							<p>Grow their following to drive more visitors and sales</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col">
							<h5>Solution: </h5>
							<p>Tactics to grow Instagram for time-strapped solo entrepreneurs</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>While you can get much more detailed, this analysis gives us a good idea of the audience we’re dealing with.</p>
					<p>Based on these points, we’ve come up with one of our most popular lead offers: the <a href="#">Instagram masterclass.</a></p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/img-16.jpg" alt="" class="img-16">

				<div class="container">
					<p>This is relevant and highly useful to our audience, but there’s another reason this webinar video has worked so well for us. The people who sign up for our webinar are the same people who will eventually be contacted to enroll in our paid, leading course, Instagram Domination.</p>
					<p>One important question you must ask yourself before you decide on your lead offer is, what’s your ultimate offer?</p>
					<p>In other words, why do you want to build your list? If it’s to promote a course, making it closely related will make your future email communications much more effective. People will want to know more about how to crush it on Instagram, so both our lead offer and our final offer are totally aligned.</p>
					<p>Alignment is the key word to consider here. Your lead offer must connect people to your final sale.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Lead Offers for Consultants/Freelancers</h4>
					<p>If you want to grow your <a href="#">consultancy or freelance business</a>, create a lead offer explaining the knowledge behind your services. </p>
					<p>For example, if you sell web development services, your lead offer can be how to keep your site secure. </p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/img-17.jpg" alt="" class="img-17">

				<div class="container">
					<p>If you think such a lead offer will make your subscribers skip your services, remember that most people want someone to solve their problems for them. They just need to know you’re the right one. If they see you know what you’re talking about, they’re more likely to hire you.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="container">
					<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Lead Offers for SaaS</h4>
					<p>If you want to grow your SaaS business, your lead offer can refer to the solutions your tool provides.</p>
					<p>For example, if you sell project management software for agencies, your lead offer can be related to developing an agency, like <a href="#">Wrike</a> does in this case:</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/img-18.jpg" alt="" class="img-18">

				<div class="container">
					<p>While this lead offer looks unrelated to what this company does, remember once you develop an agency, you will need a project management tool. And guess who the lead will think about when they need it? Wrike.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="attention">

					<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Lead Offers for Ecommerce Stores</h4>
					<p>The most common lead offers used by ecommerce stores are discounts, free shipping, and giveaways.</p>
					<p>Why are all these offers related to lowering your prices or giving away money? Because they offer immediate value—the value of owning a product at a special price.</p>
					<p>What makes a discount even more effective is when you use scarcity, like in the example below from <a href="#">BuyCustomes:</a></p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/img-19.jpg" alt="" class="img-19">

				<div class="container">
					<p>The fact that it says "first order" and "I won't see this offer again" makes people think twice before rejecting it. </p>

					<h2 class="title-h2">How to Craft Your First Lead Offer</h2>
					<p>Once you decide what lead offer to build, you need to define its structure. You can solve a specific problem in numerous ways.</p>
					<p>Using our Instagram Domination lead offer example, we could have decided to make it:</p>

					<ul class="list stars list-col-3">
						<li>A checklist</li>
						<li>A case study</li>
						<li>A list of tips</li>
						<li>A video series</li>
						<li>An email campaign</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The point is to make your lead offer simple and attractive enough that it’s a no-brainer for your subscribers to sign up for it. The type of lead offer is more of a secondary decision. </p>
					<p>It’s like deciding to go on a vacation, and whether to go by car, train, bus, or airplane. What matters is that you get to your destination in the most efficient way possible.</p>
					<p>Given the solution behind your lead offer, what’s the best way you think you can deliver it?</p>
					<p>In our case, a webinar explaining some of the tactics shown in our video course makes the most sense. If the course had no video, an ebook or another text-based lead offer would have made the most sense.</p>
					<p>You can also play to your strengths and develop a lead offer related to your favorite marketing channel.</p>

					<ul class="list circle">
						<li>If you use email marketing a lot, create an email course.</li>
						<li>If you use social media, create a simple list of tips with many images and graphics.</li>
						<li>If you use YouTube and video marketing, create a video course.</li>
						<li>If you are a blogger who focuses on writing and content marketing, develop a written piece, like an ebook. Here’s a handy guide on how to create an ebook for every budget.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Whatever you choose, don’t overextend yourself. Just as we said you shouldn’t complicate your idea or your lead offer, the same applies for your design. People want a solution, not an award-winning ebook with a solution.</p>
					<p>There are a few tools you can use to build your written lead offer, including:</p>

					<ul class="list circle">
						<li><b>Microsoft Word:</b> Simple and reliable, although not the most professional-looking</li>
						<li><b>iBooks Author:</b> Great professionally designed templates</li>
						<li><a href="#"><b>Remarq:</b></a> Perfect for creating ebooks on the fly</li>
						<li><a href="#"><b>Beacon:</b></a> Focused exclusively on lead magnets</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you want to create professional-looking graphics, you can use a tool like <a href="#">Canva.</a> You can also hire a designer, which is more expensive and complicated, or work with a company like <a href="#">DesignPickle</a> or <a href="#">Pug Shop Design</a>, both of which offer flat fees for unlimited design services.</p>
					<p>Now that you have decided on the topic and structure of your lead offer, it’s time to promote it. To do so, you will need the help of your new best friend: landing pages.</p>

			<h6 class="chapter-numbering">Chapter 3</h6>
			<h2 class="chapter-title">Landing Pages and Lead Capture Forms</h2>
	
			<img class="img-20" src="img/img-20.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>Companies that generate lots of leads and those that don’t have (at least) one thing that separates them—landing pages.</p>
				<p>A landing page is a dedicated web page with just one job—to direct all the visitor’s attention to your lead offer.</p>
				<p>Attention is the key word here. People are easily distracted. Heck, you probably have more than a dozen tabs open right now, don’t you? And what about your phone, is it beeping? Slack? Email?</p>
				<p>Attention is hard to come by. If you can get people to focus on your lead offer, while making it a no-brainer for them to act on, you’ll get more leads than you can count. A landing page can help you do just that.</p>
				<p>Landing pages have the additional benefit of helping you draw traffic from different channels, particularly paid media. You don't need to send people to your site and hope they find your lead offer. You send them to your landing page, whether from social media, a video, a display ad, or any other promotional channel.</p>

				<h3 class="title-h3">Elements of a High-Converting Landing Page</h3>
				<p>A landing page works differently than any other page you have on your site because it’s not just another page. It has one goal. You need to design it in a way that lets you make the most out of a visitor’s limited attention.</p>
				<p>Let's go through the five elements your landing page needs to have in order to convert.</p>

				<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">A Strong Headline</h4>
				<p>The headline is the first thing your visitor finds when they land on your page. At this point, their attention is at a critical point. If you catch it, you can make them read the rest of the page and get a new subscriber. If not, forget it, they'll be gone in a second.</p>
				<p>According to <a href="#">Copyblogger</a>, 80% of your visitors will never make it past the headline. To keep their attention, there are two elements every headline must have:</p>

				<div class="headline">
					<div class="col">
						<h5>Clarity</h5>
						<p>It must explain what the rest of the landing page is about</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col">
						<h5>Benefit</h5>
						<p>It must show what the reader gets by staying on the page</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Check one of our landing pages from our <a href="#">influencer guide</a> ebook:</p>
			</div>

			<img class="img-21" src="img/img-21.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>This headline explains exactly what it is about — a guide to connecting with influencers and landing interviews with them—and what you get from it — once again, connecting with influencers.</p>
				<p>You have limited space, so make it worth your visitors' time. As long as your headlines are clear and benefit-driven, you'll have their attention.</p>
				<p>A simple trick to make your hrow eadlines even more interesting is to use “power words,” which evoke an immediate emotional response. A small response, maybe, but a response nonetheless.</p>
				<p>There’s a long list of power words you can use on your titles, which you can find <a href="#">in this article</a>. Some of the most commonly used are:</p>
				<div class="words">
					<div class="row row-1">
						<span>Free</span>
						<span>You</span>
						<span>Increase</span>
					</div>	
					<div class="row row-2">
						<span>New</span>
						<span>Help</span>
						<span>Boost</span>
					</div>		
				</div>
				<p>As you can see, these aren’t groundbreaking words. What matters is not how unique they are, but how much they engage your visitors.</p>

				<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Images</h4>

				<p>Here’s another fact: 65% of your audience are visual learners. Using images can help you connect with a wider audience.</p>
				<p>The image you use doesn’t need to be anything complicated or especially beautiful (although it helps). Similar to headlines, it just needs to show what your landing page is about.</p>
				<p>The key here is to take the idea of your landing page and transform it into something tangible. That is, what the lead offer looks like in real life. This can be as simple as a 3D image of your ebook.</p>

				<h5 class="dont-tell-title">Show, don’t tell</h5>

				<p>Your headlines and copy tell what your offer is all about, but your images should show it.</p>
				<p>Take a look at what Xero does:</p>
				
			</div>

			<img class="img-22" src="img/img-22.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>Notice how the image shows the actual action of getting paid (what their users want) with the idea of accepting payments and getting paid faster. This shows a perfect match between the intent of the user and the desired action Xero wants them to take — signing up.</p>
				<p>In our case, we show a picture of what our digital <a href="#">guide to leaving your 9-to-5 job</a> would look like in real life:</p>
			</div>

			<img class="img-23" src="img/img-23.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>Even if you can't get an actual printed version of the guide, it helps the visitor visualize the benefit—they’re getting a book.</p>

				<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Compelling Copy</h4>

				<p>Once you get your visitors' attention with your headline and image, you need to have compelling copy that explains what your landing page is all about.</p>
				<p>While your headline and image catch your visitors' attention, your copy needs to direct that attention somewhere else (like your CTA, which we’ll talk about next).</p>
				<p>There are two schools of thought when it comes to landing page copy. One says you should write short copy, and one says you should write long copy. Most landing pages seem to do fine with shorter amounts of text for the simple reason people don’t need a lot of information to download a lead offer like an ebook.</p>
				<p>As a rule of thumb, the simpler the action and the object of the landing page, the shorter the copy. Since we're focusing on free lead offers like ebooks and videos, we'll keep the copy short.</p>
				<p>Look at the copy of <a href="#">this webinar</a> from Hired:</p>


			</div>

			<img class="img-24" src="img/img-24.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>The whole copy is two paragraphs highly focused on the problem at hand, and three bullet points explaining the exact benefits of watching it. What else would you possibly want to know? We also use short copy in all of our landing pages, like in our <a href="#">mentor guide ebook:</a></p>
			</div>

			<img class="img-25" src="img/img-25.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="container">
				<p>What you see above is the entire landing page. Since we already know people who visit this landing page know they need a mentor, we skip the problem part of the copy, like Hired showed you above, and went straight to the solutions.</p>

				<h4 class="title-h4 left-border">Call-to-Action</h4>

				<p>As we said before, the job of your landing page is to first catch your visitors' attention and then direct it to your call-to-action (CTA). While there’s a lot to say about CTAs, the worst thing you could do is over-complicate it and mess things up because you wanted to follow every tip you read online. The key to CTAs is <b>clarity</b> and <b>simplicity</b>, just like every other element of a landing page. The clearer the action and the more simply it's presented, the better the CTA will be. Most designers and conversion specialists recommend CTAs that:</p>

				<ul class="list stars">
					<li>Are large enough so the visitor can’t help but look at them;</li>
					<li>Use a high color contrast between the CTA and the rest of the page;</li>
					<li>Are in a prominent position within the page, like above the fold.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>But what truly matters is that people’s eyes go from your headline to your copy to your CTA.</p>
				<p>The job of your CTA is to help people finish the action set up by the rest of the landing page. While the headline, image, and copy build anticipation and desire for the free offer, the CTA leads them to it.</p>
				<p>Think of your CTA as a door to your conversion. Your door simply needs to open and close, nothing else. It needs to help people get your lead offer, which they already decided to download before they laid their eyes on it. If you add too many elements, you could distract from it and turn people away. </p>
				<p>Our <a href="#">email swipe landing page</a> has a simple CTA, which focuses on the action needed—download the file:</p>

				<p>First, we have the ”thank you” page.</p>
				<p>Why does the “thank you” page matter? Isn’t it just a simple page you put up to tell people to whitelist your email and a few words to express your gratitude?</p>

				<p>Co-marketing (commonly referred to as “partnerships”) is one of the most effective ways large companies carry out their marketing. Think about it, instead of using your own resources hoping to attract a new audience, you’re tapping into another company’s resources and audience, saving time and money.</p>
				<p>While the idea of co-marketing might seem daunting and complicated, it’s not. Don’t let the name fool you. You’re simply getting help from another company to promote to their audience, and vice-versa.</p>
				<p>For list building, the potential of co-marketing is huge. If you know another company in your space has a large list you can tap into, there’s an opportunity already.</p>

				<p>In the last two chapters, we talked about strategies for growing your list. Now we need to change gears and talk about keeping your list healthy.</p>
				<p><b>“Healthy?”</b> you say. That’s right.</p>
				<p>Health in this sense means making sure your list is full of engaged subscribers who are potential customers. That means pruning your list as it accumulates lower-quality names and some subscribers start to tune you out.</p>
				<p>Here’s how you do it.</p>

				<h3 class="title-h3">Qualify Your List</h3>

				<div class="row text-2-col">
					<div class="col">
						<p>There’s one mantra you need to remember when building your list: quality beats quantity.</p>
						<p>We know you want to open your email marketing service provider and see a five-figure number. But there’s much more behind your list than a number.</p>
						<p>You see, marketing is all about targeting. The better you target your audience, the more effective your marketing is and the more money you make (or the less money you spend targeting the incorrect people).</p>
						<p>When you use a billboard to promote your company, you can’t make the people who aren’t in your target audience ignore it, but you can do something like this online.</p>
						<p>One benefit of email marketing is that it lets you track the effectiveness of your campaigns with a level of detail unseen in other marketing channels. You can see who opens, clicks, and converts from your emails.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col">
						<p>If you have the wrong people in your list—people who aren’t interested in your offers and who never open or click your emails—you will spend money communicating to people who are simply left alone.</p>
						<p>There’s only one way to overcome that problem from the start: by offering a highly relevant lead magnet that only your target audience would want.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, even if you develop a great lead magnet, some members of your audience will stop paying attention to your emails. To find out who likes getting your emails and who doesn’t, you need to segment your list.</p>
